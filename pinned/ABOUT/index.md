# 🧭 What this blog is

Over time, my interests expanded beyond software development alone, and GitHub started to feel limiting as a place for exploration. This blog exists as a space to think, write, and document work that does not always fit neatly into code repositories.

It serves as a **personal knowledge base and writing space**.

Here you’ll find:
- short and long-form articles
- notes from ongoing projects
- diagrams, images, and supporting materials
- ideas worth revisiting or refining later

Think of it as a **living notebook**, not a polished publication. The blog is built as a static website and generated directly from a [Git repository](https://github.com/antkrit/antkrit/tree/main/posts).

# ✍️ How to read it

The content is not organized by importance, but by time and curiosity.

Some posts are:
- exploratory
- opinionated
- intentionally incomplete

If something feels unfinished, it probably is - and that is part of the process.
