# 💫 About Me:
👋 Hi, I’m a developer with a passion for building efficient and interesting solutions. I like projects where theory meets practice! Some of these experiments turn into polished projects, some remain notes or prototypes 😁

My projects often reflect what I’m learning and experimenting with, whether it’s development, exploring new things or just playing with something.

Feel free to take a look around. Always open to ideas and collaborations! ✉️
